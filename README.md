Athena is a fully voice-controlled fitness training app designed for hands-free workouts.  
The system uses AI to understand voice commands, generate workout sessions, guide you through exercises, and adapt intensity in real time.  
Everything—navigation, workout control, and coaching—is done by voice, making the app simple, accessible, and completely touch-free.
